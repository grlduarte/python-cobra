# Python Cobra

In this second version I try to create a exact remake of the original Snake II from Nokia 3000 series.

Also, there's a lot of new things: a interactive menu. Using images to draw the snake and interfaces exactly like the Nokia's. Also using multiple .py files now, one for each screen of the app, so the mess is gone (hopefully).
