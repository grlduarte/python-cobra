# Python Cobra

This is my attempt to create an exact remake of the original Snake II from Nokia 3000 series.

There's a functioning interactive menu,
I'm using images to draw the snake and interfaces exactly like the Nokia's,
Also the screens are separated in multiple .py files, so the mess is gone (hopefully).
